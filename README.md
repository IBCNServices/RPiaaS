# RPiaaS - Raspberry Pi as a Service
A Raspberry Pi Cloud Testbed 

## Introduction

Raspberry Pi as a Service (**RPiaaS**) is a low-cost and energy-efficient cloud testbed built using [Raspberry Pi's](https://www.raspberrypi.org). The testbed consists of multiple worker nodes, which can be aggregated in small clusters. Every node in the cluster is interconnected, and there is a master node managing the whole testbed. This master node can be a Raspberry Pi or any device running a Linux distribution.

RPiaaS provides an easy-to-use cloud environment for experimentation and validation of resource management experiments, and is initially designed to facilitate the step from simulations towards experimental evaluations on larger cloud testbeds. The developed software however is easy to extend and/or customize, for example to use it for managing a classroom environment or to build a multimedia streaming cluster.

## Source Code will be released soon

We are currently cleaning up the source code and finishing all documentation. All code and documentation will be released very soon, so please come back to this page in a few weeks.

## Disclaimer

RPiaaS is developed at [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/en) - [IDLab](https://www.ugent.be/ea/idlab/en). We strongly encourage fellow researchers within the field to try out and customize the code for their own research projects. If you use this code for your own projects, please give credit to the original authors.
